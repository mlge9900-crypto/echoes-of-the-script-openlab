# Templates

Downloadable Falsifiability Sheet templates. Pick the one that fits your stage in the workflow.

## Blank Sheet

**File:** `Falsifiability_Sheet_v5vai2_Blank.pdf`

Start here if you are the **first author** making a claim about an artifact. You fill in every field from scratch: the artifact context, your evidence, confidence ratings, prep notes, and (optionally) AI-assisted analysis. Hand it off to R1 and R2 reviewers when you're done.

## R2-ready Sheet

**File:** `2nd rater ready Falsifiability Sheet.pdf`

Use this if you are the **second reviewer (R2)**. The claim and evidence sections are already filled in by the original author and verified by R1. Your job is to stress-test the entry: look for contradictions, alternative explanations, or evidence gaps, then record a definitive outcome (Confirmed / Revise / Defer / Unproven).

## How to use

1. Download the PDF you need
2. Fill it in following the [12-step workflow](../README.md#the-12-step-workflow) in the main README
3. If any field doesn't apply, mark it **N/A** — don't leave it blank or guess
